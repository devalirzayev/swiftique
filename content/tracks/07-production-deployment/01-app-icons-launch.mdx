# App Icons & Launch Screen

When you create a new iOS app, one of the first things users see is your app icon on their home screen and a brief launch screen while your app starts. These visual elements are crucial for user experience and App Store approval. In this article, you'll learn how to properly configure app icons and launch screens using Xcode's asset catalog system.

## Why App Icons and Launch Screens Matter

**App Icons** serve as your app's brand identity. They appear on the home screen, in search results, in Settings, and throughout iOS. Apple has strict requirements for app icons, and failing to meet them will result in App Store rejection.

**Launch Screens** provide immediate visual feedback that your app is loading. They're not splash screens for branding—they should seamlessly transition into your app's first screen. A poorly designed launch screen creates a jarring user experience.

## Understanding Asset Catalogs

Asset catalogs (`.xcassets` files) are Xcode's solution for managing app resources like images, icons, and colors. They automatically handle different device resolutions, screen sizes, and operating system versions.

When you create a new project, Xcode generates an `Assets.xcassets` folder with two key components:
- `AppIcon` - for your app icons
- `LaunchScreen` (or a Launch Screen storyboard in older projects)

### Why Use Asset Catalogs?

Asset catalogs provide several benefits:
- **Automatic scaling**: Provide @1x, @2x, and @3x versions of images
- **Organization**: Keep all visual assets in one place
- **Optimization**: Xcode optimizes assets during compilation
- **Platform-specific assets**: Different resources for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, etc.

## Configuring App Icons

### Icon Size Requirements

iOS requires app icons in multiple sizes for different contexts. As of iOS 17, you need to provide icons at these primary sizes:

- **iPhone**: 60x60pt (@2x and @3x)
- **iPad**: 76x76pt (@2x)
- **App Store**: 1024x1024pt (@1x)
- **Settings**: 29x29pt (@2x and @3x)
- **Spotlight**: 40x40pt (@2x and @3x)

Points (pt) vs pixels: iOS uses points as a device-independent unit. A @2x image means 2 pixels per point, and @3x means 3 pixels per point.

### Adding App Icons to Your Project

1. **Open your Asset Catalog**: In Xcode's Project Navigator, click on `Assets.xcassets`
2. **Select AppIcon**: Click on "AppIcon" in the left sidebar
3. **Drag and drop images**: Drop your PNG files into the appropriate slots

**Critical requirements:**
- PNG format only (no transparency for iOS icons)
- Exact pixel dimensions (not approximate)
- sRGB color space
- No alpha channel

### Programmatically Accessing App Icon Information

While you can't change the app icon through standard APIs (see alternate app icons below), you can check if certain properties are set:

```swift
import UIKit

// Check if the app has an icon set
if let iconsDictionary = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["CFBundleIcons"] as? [String: Any],
   let primaryIconsDictionary = iconsDictionary["CFBundlePrimaryIcon"] as? [String: Any],
   let iconFiles = primaryIconsDictionary["CFBundleIconFiles"] as? [String] {
    print("App icon files: \(iconFiles)")
}
```

### Alternate App Icons

iOS allows users to change your app's icon (available since iOS 10.3). This requires configuring alternate icons in your project.

**Step 1:** Add alternate icon images to your project (NOT in the asset catalog—add them directly to your project folder). Name them distinctly, like "DarkIcon@2x.png", "DarkIcon@3x.png".

**Step 2:** Update your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleIcons</key>
<dict>
    <key>CFBundleAlternateIcons</key>
    <dict>
        <key>DarkIcon</key>
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
            <array>
                <string>DarkIcon</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

**Step 3:** Implement icon switching in Swift:

```swift
import UIKit

class IconManager {
    static func changeAppIcon(to iconName: String?) {
        guard UIApplication.shared.supportsAlternateIcons else {
            print("Alternate icons not supported on this device")
            return
        }
        
        UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIconName(iconName) { error in
            if let error = error {
                print("Error setting alternate icon: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            } else {
                print("Successfully changed app icon")
            }
        }
    }
    
    static func resetToDefaultIcon() {
        changeAppIcon(to: nil) // nil resets to default
    }
    
    static var currentIconName: String? {
        return UIApplication.shared.alternateIconName
    }
}

// Usage
IconManager.changeAppIcon(to: "DarkIcon")
```

**Common mistake:** iOS shows a system alert when changing icons. You cannot suppress this alert—it's a privacy/security feature.

## Configuring Launch Screens

Apple deprecated static launch images in favor of launch screens created with Interface Builder or SwiftUI. Modern iOS apps use a `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file or, starting with iOS 14, a `Info.plist` configuration.

### Launch Screen Storyboard (Traditional Approach)

The `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file is included in new Xcode projects. Best practices:

**Do:**
- Use a simplified version of your first screen
- Use Auto Layout for all devices
- Keep it minimal (no animations, no web content, no dynamic data)

**Don't:**
- Add branding splash screens (Apple rejects these)
- Include text that requires localization
- Display loading indicators

Example layout code for a programmatically-created launch screen view controller:

```swift
import UIKit

class LaunchScreenViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
        
        let logoImageView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "logo"))
        logoImageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
        logoImageView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        
        view.addSubview(logoImageView)
        
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            logoImageView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
            logoImageView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor),
            logoImageView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 120),
            logoImageView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 120)
        ])
    }
}
```

**Note:** You don't instantiate this view controller yourself. It's only used as a reference for the storyboard design.

### Modern Approach: Info.plist Configuration (iOS 14+)

Starting with iOS 14, you can configure launch screens purely through `Info.plist`, which is faster and more efficient.

```xml
<key>UILaunchScreen</key>
<dict>
    <key>UIColorName</key>
    <string>LaunchScreenBackground</string>
    <key>UIImageName</key>
    <string>LaunchLogo</string>
    <key>UIImageRespectsSafeAreaInsets</key>
    <true/>
    <key>UILaunchScreenShowsNavigationBar</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
```

**Keys explained:**
- `UIColorName`: References a color in your asset catalog
- `UIImageName`: References an image in your asset catalog (centered by default)
- `UIImageRespectsSafeAreaInsets`: If true, image respects safe areas
- `UILaunchScreenShowsNavigationBar`: Shows a navigation bar if true

### Accessing Launch Screen Programmatically

You typically don't interact with launch screens programmatically, but you can check which method is being used:

```swift
import UIKit

class LaunchScreenChecker {
    static func getLaunchScreenType() -> String {
        // Check if using storyboard
        if let launchStoryboard = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["UILaunchStoryboardName"] as? String {
            return "Using storyboard: \(launchStoryboard)"
        }
        
        // Check if using Info.plist configuration
        if Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["UILaunchScreen"] != nil {
            return "Using Info.plist configuration"
        }
        
        return "No launch screen configured"
    }
}

// Usage
print(LaunchScreenChecker.getLaunchScreenType())
```

### Testing Launch Screens

Launch screens are cached aggressively by iOS. When testing changes:

1. **Delete the app** from the device/simulator completely
2. **Clean build folder** (Cmd+Shift+K in Xcode)
3. **Rebuild and reinstall**

**Alternative:** Restart the device/simulator to clear the cache.

```swift
// Add this code to force a delay during development to observe launch screen
#if DEBUG
Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 2.0) // Only for testing—never ship this!
#endif
```

## Edge Cases and Common Mistakes

### Missing Icon Sizes

**Problem:** You submit to the App Store but forgot the 1024x1024 icon.

**Solution:** Xcode shows a warning in the asset catalog. Always check the AppIcon entry for any empty slots with a yellow warning triangle.

### Transparent App Icons

**Problem:** Your designer provides an icon with transparency.

**Result:** App Store rejection or black background where transparency was.

**Solution:** Always use opaque backgrounds. iOS adds its own rounded corners—don't pre-round your icons.

```swift
// Utility to check if an image has transparency (useful for validation)
extension UIImage {
    var hasAlpha: Bool {
        guard let cgImage = self.cgImage else { return false }
        let alpha = cgImage.alphaInfo
        return alpha == .first || alpha == .last || alpha == .premultipliedFirst || alpha == .premultipliedLast
    }
}

// Usage
if let icon = UIImage(named: "AppIconTestImage"), icon.hasAlpha {
    print("Warning: Icon has transparency")
}
```

### Launch Screen Not Updating

**Problem:** You update your launch screen but it still shows the old version.

**Solution:** iOS caches launch screens. Delete the app and reinstall, or restart the device.

### Localized Text on Launch Screens

**Problem:** You add text to your launch screen that should be localized.

**Apple's guideline:** Launch screens shouldn't contain text. If you must include text, it should be part of an image or require manual localization of the storyboard.

**Better solution:** Don't use text. Use visual elements that are universally recognizable.

### Dark Mode Considerations

Your launch screen should support both light and dark mode. In asset catalogs, you can provide different images for each appearance:

```swift
// In your asset catalog, select an image set
// In the Attributes Inspector, set "Appearances" to "Any, Light, Dark"
// Then drag appropriate images for each mode
```

For storyboards, use system colors that automatically adapt:

```swift
// In Interface Builder or programmatically
view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground // Adapts automatically
label.textColor = .label // Adapts automatically
```

## Testing on Different Devices

Always test on various screen sizes. You can check the current device programmatically:

```swift
import UIKit

struct DeviceInfo {
    static var modelName: String {
        var systemInfo = utsname()
        uname(&systemInfo)
        let machineMirror = Mirror(reflecting: systemInfo.machine)
        let identifier = machineMirror.children.reduce("") { identifier, element in
            guard let value = element.value as? Int8, value != 0 else { return identifier }
            return identifier + String(UnicodeScalar(UInt8(value)))
        }
        return identifier
    }
    
    static var screenSize: CGSize {
        return UIScreen.main.bounds.size
    }
    
    static var scale: CGFloat {
        return UIScreen.main.scale
    }
}

// Usage during testing
print("Device: \(DeviceInfo.modelName)")
print("Screen size: \(DeviceInfo.screenSize)")
print("Scale: \(DeviceInfo.scale)x")
```

## Automated Icon Generation

Instead of manually creating every icon size, you can use scripts or third-party tools. Here's a basic approach using command-line tools:

```swift
// This is a shell script example (save as generate_icons.sh)
// Not Swift, but useful for automation
/*
#!/bin/bash

# Requires ImageMagick: brew install imagemagick

SOURCE_IMAGE="icon_1024.png"

# iPhone sizes
sips -z 120 120   $SOURCE_IMAGE --out AppIcon-60@2x.png
sips -z 180 180   $SOURCE_IMAGE --out AppIcon-60@3x.png

# iPad sizes
sips -z 152 152   $SOURCE_IMAGE --out AppIcon-76@2x.png

# Settings
sips -z 58 58     $SOURCE_IMAGE --out AppIcon-29@2x.png
sips -z 87 87     $SOURCE_IMAGE --out AppIcon-29@3x.png

# Spotlight
sips -z 80 80     $SOURCE_IMAGE --out AppIcon-40@2x.png
sips -z 120 120   $SOURCE_IMAGE --out AppIcon-40@3x.png
*/
```

## Official Apple Guidelines

Always refer to the official documentation:

- **Human Interface Guidelines - App Icons**: Provides design guidance, including size, color, and style recommendations
- **Asset Catalog Format Reference**: Technical specification for `.xcassets` structure
- **UILaunchScreen Documentation**: Details on Info.plist configuration for launch screens

Key takeaways from Apple's guidelines:
1. App icons should be distinctive and memorable
2. Avoid placing text on app icons
3. Fill the entire icon area
4. Use safe, inclusive imagery
5. Test on actual devices, not just simulator
