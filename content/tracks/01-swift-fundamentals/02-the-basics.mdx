# The Basics

Swift provides fundamental building blocks for working with data. Let's explore each one.

## Constants and Variables

Use `let` for constants (values that don't change) and `var` for variables (values that can change):

```swift
let maximumLoginAttempts = 10
var currentLoginAttempt = 0

currentLoginAttempt += 1
```

> **Rule of thumb:** Always use `let` unless you know the value needs to change. Xcode will warn you if you use `var` for a value that never changes.

## Type Annotations

Swift can infer types, but you can also be explicit:

```swift
let name: String = "Swift"
let version: Double = 6.0
let isAwesome: Bool = true
var year: Int = 2024
```

Most of the time, type inference is preferred — it keeps code cleaner:

```swift
let name = "Swift"
let version = 6.0
let isAwesome = true
```

## Integers

Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit forms:

```swift
let minInt8 = Int8.min
let maxInt8 = Int8.max
let maxUInt8 = UInt8.max
let age: Int = 25
```

## Floating-Point Numbers

```swift
let pi = 3.14159
let e: Float = 2.71828
```

> **Prefer `Double`** — Swift defaults to `Double` when inferring floating-point types, and it provides at least 15 decimal digits of precision.

## Type Safety and Type Inference

Swift is type-safe — it won't let you mix types accidentally:

```swift
let meaningOfLife = 42
let pi = 3.14159
let sum = Double(meaningOfLife) + pi
```

## Tuples

Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value:

```swift
let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")
print(http404Error.0)
print(http404Error.1)

let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")
print(http200Status.statusCode)
print(http200Status.description)
```

## Optionals

An optional says "there is a value, and it equals x" or "there isn't a value at all":

```swift
var serverResponseCode: Int? = 404
serverResponseCode = nil

if let code = serverResponseCode {
    print("Response code: \(code)")
} else {
    print("No response")
}

func processResponse(_ code: Int?) {
    guard let code = code else {
        print("No response code")
        return
    }
    print("Processing code: \(code)")
}

let displayCode = serverResponseCode ?? 0
```

## Summary

| Concept | Keyword | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Constant | `let` | `let name = "Swift"` |
| Variable | `var` | `var count = 0` |
| Integer | `Int` | `let age: Int = 25` |
| Floating-point | `Double` | `let pi = 3.14` |
| Boolean | `Bool` | `let active = true` |
| Tuple | `()` | `let pair = (1, "one")` |
| Optional | `?` | `var name: String?` |
