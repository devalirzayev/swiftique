# About Swift

Swift is a powerful, intuitive programming language created by Apple for building apps across all Apple platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS.

## Why Swift?

Swift was designed with three goals in mind:

- **Safe** — Swift eliminates entire categories of bugs. Variables are always initialized before use, arrays and integers are checked for overflow, and memory is managed automatically.
- **Fast** — Swift code is compiled to optimized native code using the LLVM compiler. Its performance is comparable to C and C++.
- **Expressive** — Swift's syntax is clean and modern, making code easier to read and write.

## A Brief History

Swift was introduced at WWDC 2014 as a replacement for Objective-C. Since then it has evolved rapidly:

| Version | Year | Key Feature |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Swift 1.0 | 2014 | Initial release |
| Swift 2.0 | 2015 | Error handling, protocol extensions |
| Swift 3.0 | 2016 | API design guidelines, open source |
| Swift 4.0 | 2017 | Codable, String overhaul |
| Swift 5.0 | 2019 | ABI stability |
| Swift 5.5 | 2021 | async/await, actors |
| Swift 6.0 | 2024 | Strict concurrency, complete sendable checking |

## Open Source

Swift is [open source](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift). The language, compiler, standard library, and package manager are all developed in the open. This means Swift evolves based on community feedback and contributions.

## What You'll Learn

In this track, you'll master Swift from the ground up — starting with variables and types, through functions and closures, to protocols, generics, and concurrency. Every concept is taught with practical examples you can run in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds.

Let's get started.
